# üßê Project philosophy
> A Food Delivery application that allows users to order food from a list of restaurants.
> The Food Delivery backend is built using GoLang and uses PostgreSQL as a database. 
> 
> The Food Delivery backend is part of a project that [Crunch Garage](https://crunchgarage.com/) is working on. This project is currently working on the backend and database.


# üìí Database Model

This project repository has [a great wiki](https://github.com/CossyCossy/food-delivery/wiki) (currently WIP) that you should consider reading! It goes into detail about the project from a more technical aspect. If you are interested in learning more about the project itself, go ahead and check it out!

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Food Delivery backend is built on.:

- üö®This project uses the [GoLang development framework](https://go.dev/). .
- For persistent storage (database), the project uses the [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/) package which allows the project to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- The project uses the [JWT](https://jwt.io/) package to create and verify JWT tokens.
